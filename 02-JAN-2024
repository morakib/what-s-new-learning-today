----------------------
1. possible &= (rem % X == 0 );

2. every number can be represented as multiples of prime ,so if we are given 2 are given two integers a and b,
   which are the two largest divisors of the number x.
   here could be 2 possibilities 
   a=x/p1                  (here p1 is the smallest prime) 
   b=x/(p1*p1) or b=x/p2   (here p2 is the 2nd smallest or square of the 1st smallest prime number)

3. if n is a square  number and if we multiply wtih another sqr it will also be a sqr,and length of the string is odd so 
   169,961,196-length of 3
   13*13*10*10=16900,96100,19600 ,,multiplying with 10's even power..
